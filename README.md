### step 0 (I did it)
    hello world

[slide]
### step 1
    As a user,
    I want to input an url in address bar,
    so that I can visit a web page which is named the bookshelf.

[slide]
### step 2
    As a user,
    I want to add a new book,
    so that I can enrich my bookshelf, and see more books on it.

[slide]
### step 3
    As a user,
    I want to view, edit, and delete each book on bookshelf,
    so that I can manage my bookshelf easy.
